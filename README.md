It was a long-term one year Final Year Project for my bachelors degree. All the learning of Computer Science concepts, theories and research have been applied in this project. Grade Your Code is an online platform where teachers can make programming questions or pick questions from a library of programming questions and post a quiz comprising of these questions. They also decide the grading criteria for every question according to test cases. Plagiarism rate is mentioned by the instructor. On the student&amp;#39;s side, there is a compiler, which lets student to try their code again and again and show the result of test cases implemented on his code.
