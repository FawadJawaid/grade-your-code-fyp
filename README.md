# Grade Your Code - Final Year Project (Bachelor Thesis)
It was a long-term one year Final Year Project for my bachelors degree. All the learning of Computer Science concepts, theories and research have been applied in this project. 

## Project Overview
Grade Your Code is an online platform where teachers can
make programming questions or pick questions from a library
of programming questions and post a quiz comprising of these
questions. They also decide the grading criteria for every
question according to test cases. Plagiarism rate is mentioned
by the instructor.

On the student's side, there is a compiler, which lets
student to try their code again and again and show the result of
test cases implemented on his code. When the student gets
satisfied by his result he can submit the answer and he will get
the grades according to grading and plagiarism criteria. There
is also a timer and a counter to note the time taken to solve the
questions and the number of retries by the student, which will
be used to determine the difficulty level of question as well as
skill level of student.
