       <b> <p>GradeYourCode provides a platform to the teachers to conduct online programming quizzes. It facilitates the instructors teaching programming courses with the facility of checking the quizzes. It also provides the easiest way to students to code their assignment online. This system would be very useful for catching plagiarism cases and hence restricting the students from copying each other's code.</p><p>
               GradeYourCode consists of a web portal which contains an online compiler of C, C++ and Java and a plagiarism detection engine. Moreover, it has an automatic grading system which assists the teachers to grade the programming quizzes. Grading is based on the number of quizzes satisfied by the code submitted by the student and the plagiarism percentage determined by the plagiarism detection engine.</p><p>
GradeYourCode facilitates the teacher with the facility to make programming questions and also provides a list of questions shared by other teachers. The teacher has the facility to create a quiz, add questions and test cases, add starting and ending time, assign points to each question and select the students who can attempt the quiz. The instructor is asked to mention the grading criteria for every question according to the test cases. Plagiarism rate is also defined by the teacher.</p><p>
On the student's side, there is a compiler. The students can login through their student IDs and then they can start coding in C, C++ or Java. Using the online compiler, the students can compile their code, run the test cases given by the teacher, remove the bugs and view the output of their code. The students can run their code again and again and can also view the result of the test cases implemented on their code. The students are also able to check the plagiarism percentage of their codes. When the student gets satisfied by the output of his/her code then he/she can submit their code. The students will get the grades according to the grading and plagiarism criteria. They are allowed to submit their code till the deadline mentioned by the teacher. Only the teacher have the authority to change the deadline. The students are not able to submit their quizzes after the deadline. There is also a timer and a counter to note the time taken to solve the questions and number of retries by student, which will be used to determine the difficulty level of question as well as skill level of student. A student can view his profile, the courses in which he/she are registered and the quizzes given by the teacher. The system grades the codes written by the students basis of the number of test cases running successfully and the plagiarism percentage.
