   <b> <p>We are the students of National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences Karachi campus. 
        Currently we are in the final year and final semester of the 4-year degree program of Bachelors of Computer Science.
        We have studied all the core courses of our degree program including Computer Programming, Data Structures, Database Systems, Object oriented Analysis and Design, Designs and Principles of Algorithms and Software Engineering.
        We have got good programming skills in C, C++, C# and Java. The electives or optional courses that we have studied so far include Design Patterns, Requirements Engineering and Software Quality Assurance. </p><p>We have worked on a number of projects based on the programming languages mentioned earlier. We have developed mobile applications as well as a web application. We are about to graduate, so we are looking forward to work in an elite class organization where we get opportunities to polish our skills and work on worldwide projects. </p>
